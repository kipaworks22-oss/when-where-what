When Where What — Branded Static Landing Page

How to publish (no coding needed):

Option A — Drag & Drop Hosting (easiest)
1) Zip this folder and drag-drop it to a static hosting service that supports drag-and-drop deploys (e.g., Netlify Drop).
2) You’ll get a live URL immediately.

Option B — GitHub Pages
1) Create a GitHub repo, upload index.html, logo.svg, favicon.svg.
2) In repo Settings → Pages, choose “Deploy from a branch”, then select main branch / root.
3) Your site will be published at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

Option C — Any static host
Upload the files to any provider that can serve static files (Vercel static, Cloudflare Pages, S3/CloudFront, etc.).
